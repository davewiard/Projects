# learning

This repository contains source code in numerous languages. These sources were
all created as a part of a learning or studying task associated with an
interview or an online course (e.g. Pluralsight, Udemy, etc.) I was taking.
These should in no way be considered production-level code as I was frequently
in the process of learning the constructs of the language at the time of their
writing.
